Enrich video files in a Camlistore with metadata from TheMovieDB

This is work in progress, not yet usable software.

The goal is to query TheMovieDB for metadata to video files that are stored in a Camlistore instance and add that metadata to the permanodes. The first version will add titles, descriptions and poster art for movies. Support for TV shows is planned for a later version.
